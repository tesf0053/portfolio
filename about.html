                Blue Nile is an Ethiopia Restaurant located in ottawa. We provide Ethiopian and others cultral dishes. In Ethiopia, we use a grain called teff in foods such as "enjera", a sourdough-type flat and sponge bread with which our meals are served. Teff is high in calcium, phosphorus, iron, copper, aluminium, barium, and thiamine contents. Iron from teff is easily absorbed by the body, thus enhancing the performance of elite athletes. Rich in amino composition, including all 8 amino acids for humans, teff is more lysine than wheat and barley. It is also high in carbohydrates and fibre.
                
                Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony
                
                More than 1,000 years ago, a goatherder in Ethiopia’s south-western highlands plucked a few red berries from some young green trees growing there in the forest and tasted them. He liked the flavour – and the feel-good effect that followed. Today those self-same berries, dried, roasted and ground, have become the world’s second most popular non-alcoholic beverage after tea. And the Ethiopian province where they first blossomed – Kaffa – gave its name to coffee.
                
                The Coffee Ceremony is an experience unique to Ethopian Dining – one that requires a full day’s notice for preparation. Don’t forget to mention it when making your reservation!</p>
