# Welcome to my portfolio

## Process

Before writing the code, I designed my web page in Adobe XD and finished everything inside them, including the interactions. After that, I created a git repository, project folders and files, and then cloned with VS code editor. I built this personal business site by following my XD design and using the bootstrap framework and customized CSS.


## Challege

At first, time, knowing the bootstrap class name was the very challenging part. Also, customizing the colour and other staff was a difficult part. And I overcame this challenge by practicing more, revising class recording videos and learning from other external websites.
